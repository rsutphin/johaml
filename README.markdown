Johaml
======

Johaml is java infrastructure code for using [Haml and Sass][haml] from a java webapp.  It is not a port -- it provides a translation layer which adapts the haml library to J2EE conventions via JRuby.

It is currently based on Haml 2.0.2 and leans heavily on infrastructure code provided by [Freemarker 2.3][fm].

Johaml is alpha software.  It works okay, but is missing some key features and performance is not ideal.
